## Challenges I faced

- Making the App multi language : I solve this challenge by using easy localization package to implement multi language support smoothly
- Making the App Responsive : I solved this challenge by making use of 
```
  MediaQuery.of(context).size
``` 
to get device width and render the UI in respect to the device's width
